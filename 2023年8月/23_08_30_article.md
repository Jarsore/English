China tries to figure out whom a hit song is mocking
===

# Para I : 小说背景

In the story "Luocha Haishi"a Chinese merchant gets lost at sea and ends up in a faraway land.The place is called Luocha,a word that refers to demons.But its people say they value beauty above all else,including in their leaders.So the merchant is shocked to find that the leaders have goblin-like faces.The higher their rank, the uglier they get. To win their favour, the merchant smears his own face with coal. The story, written by Pu Songling, a novelist during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), is a metaphor about hypocrisy.

在小说《罗刹海市》中，一个中国商人在海上迷失，来到了一个遥远的国度。这个地方被称为“罗刹”，意味着妖魔之地。然而，这里的人们称他们非常看重美，连做官都要看长相。因此，当商人发现这里的领导竟然长着妖怪一般的面孔，他大为震惊。而且，职位越高，相貌越丑。为了赢得他们的好感，商人用煤炭把自己的脸涂黑。这个故事出自清代（1644-1912）小说家蒲松龄之手，旨在讽刺虚伪言行。

# Para II: 歌词内涵

It also shares its name with this summer’s hottest pop song in China. The ditty was released in July and quickly rose to the top of the country’s music platforms, inspiring hundreds of commentaries. Part of the song’s appeal is its cryptic message. The lyrics by Dao Lang, the 52-year-old singer, refer to someone as a “donkey” (slang for fool) and someone else as a “chicken” (slang for prostitute). Chinese are busy debating whom the artist is mocking.

# Para III: 刀郎经历

Some clues may be found in Dao Lang’s history. Originally from the province of Sichuan, he became famous in the early 2000s for his ballads celebrating migrant life in China’s far west. His songs were popular with blue-collar workers and farmers. But in 2010 a judge on a televised singing competition criticised his work, saying it lacked “aesthetic perspective”. Dao Lang produced little for the next decade.

我们或许可以在刀郎的经历中找到一些线索。他原本来自四川省，在21世纪00年代初因民谣走红，他的歌谣赞颂了中国西部农民工的生活，在蓝领工人和农民种很受欢迎。但在 2010 年，一位在电视歌唱比赛中担任评委的艺人批评了他的作品，称刀郎的歌缺乏“审美视角”。此后的十年里，刀郎很少创作。

Other theories are more convoluted, such as that Dao Lang is attacking America. One version of this idea assumes the lyrics refer to Joe Biden, transgender officials and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance comprising America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. It seems a little far-fetched.

其它解读更为复杂，比如有人认为刀郎在抨击美国。其中一个版本认为，歌词指的是拜登、跨性别官员和美国、澳大利亚、英国、加拿大、新西兰组成的五眼情报联盟。这种解读似乎有些牵强。

# Para IV: 网友解读3

At the end of his song, Dao Lang throws in a tongue-twisting reference to Ludwig Wittgenstein, a 20th-century Austrian philosopher. He seems to be drawing on Wittgenstein’s ideas about how language can distort reality. Some believe the song, then, is a broader critique of society. Others say it is nonsense. Dao Lang himself isn’t talking.

在歌曲结尾，刀郎插入了一段绕口令，提到了20世纪奥地利哲学家路德维希·维特根斯坦。他似乎在借用维特根斯坦的理论，即语言如何颠倒黑白。有人认为这首歌是对社会的更广泛批判，也有人认为这首歌胡言乱语。刀郎本人却没有多言。

Like everything metaphysical the harmoney between thought and reality is to be found in the grammar of the language.
