## 1 《教父》里柯里昂说

It’s true I have many, many friends in politics, but they would not be so friendly if my business were narcotics instead of gambling. 
They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice, and they think narcotics a dirty business.

没错，我在政坛上有许许多多朋友，但我的生意假如不是赌博而是毒品，他们对我恐怕就没那么友好了。他们认为赌博和烈酒一样，有伤风化但无害，但他们认为毒品很肮脏。

## 2 《经济学人》给恐怖分子头目本·拉登写的讣告

Somewhere was a man who loved sunflowers, and eating yogurt with honey; who took his children to the beach, and let them sleep under the stars.

在他内心的某个角落里，栖居着一个这样的男人：爱向日葵，也爱喝加蜂蜜的酸奶，会带着孩子去沙滩，也会让他们酣睡于星空之下。

## 3 兵者，诡道也。

The deception has a place in warfare.

# Part 1 不愠

## 4 兵者，国之大事，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也。

War is a grave affair of the state; it is a place of life and death, a road to survival and extinction, a matter to be pondered carefully.

## 5 《孙子兵法》

主不可以怒而兴师，将不可以愠而攻战。

A ruler must never mobilize his men out of anger; a general must never engage [in] battle out of spite. 

合于利而动，不合于利而止。

怒可以复喜，愠可以复说，亡国不可以复存，死者不可以复生。

Anger can turn to pleasure; spite can turn to joy. 
But a nation destroyed cannot be put back together again; A dead man cannot be brought back to life. 

故明主慎之，良将警之。此安国全军之道也。

So the enlightened ruler is prudent; the effective general is cautious.
This is the Way to keep a nation at peace and an army intact.

## 6 《教父》

Hagen had learned the art of negotiation from the Don himself. “Never get angry,” the Don had instructed. “Never make a threat. Reason with people.”

黑根的谈判技巧是唐亲自传授的。“永远不要动怒，”唐这么教导他，“决不要威胁，要讲道理。

## 7 《孙子兵法》

道者，令民与上同意也。

The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler.

# Part 3 诡道

兵者，诡道也。

All warfare is based on deception. 

故能而示之不能，用而示之不用，近而示之远，远而示之近；

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; 
when far away, we must make him believe we are near. 

利而诱之，乱而取之，实而备之，强而避之……

Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.

# Part 4 不战

不战而屈人之兵，善之善者也。

Ultimate excellence lies not in winning every battle, but in defeating the enemy without ever fighting.

## 8 如何不战而屈人之兵：

故上兵伐谋，其次伐交，其次伐兵，其下攻城。攻城之法，为不得已。

The highest form of warfare is to attack [the enemy's] strategy itself; 

The next, to attack [his] alliances. 

The next, to attack armies; 

The lowest form of war is to attack cities. 

Siege warfare is a last resort.

# Part 5 以多胜少

故用兵之法，十则围之，五则攻之，倍则分之，敌则能战之，少则能逃之，不若则能避之。

It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.

If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.

Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.
