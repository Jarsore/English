Opposite a university campus on the outskirts of Jakarta, motorbikes line the front of Ricky Salim’s ice-cream and tea store. 
One of thousands of Mixue franchise owners across Asia, Mr Salim says his business is so good he hopes to open more outlets this year. 
Mixue, a Chinese firm which built its brand selling flavoured teas and soft-serve ice-cream in smaller Chinese cities with relatively modest average incomes, is exporting its model across South-East Asia. 
Its nearly 22,000 franchised stores worldwide, by early last year, made it the fifth-largest fast-food chain in the world by outlet, behind McDonald’s, Subway, Starbucks and kfc.

Part of the reason for Mixue's success is that it sells rising Asia's favourite drink:bubble(or "boba")tea,a milky tea containing chewy tapioca balls.
In China,the market for these newfangled,flavoured teas was twice that for coffee in 2021,with a $20bn turnover,according to Momentum Works,a research firm in Singapore.
As growth has slowed in China,bubble-tea brands have set their sights on South-East Asia,where the market was worth $4bn.
Several other large,Chinese,ready-made tea brands,including HeyTea,Nayuki Tea,ChaGee and Happy Lemon,have also moved into the region.
